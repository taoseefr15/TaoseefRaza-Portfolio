      "I’m Taoseef Raza, an MCA student, learning to build modern web applications using technologies like React.js, Node.js and MongoDB.

      "My name is Taoseef Raza, and I am an MCA student. I started with core programming concepts and slowly moved into web development because I enjoy creating real, usable applications instead of just theory.",
      "I am learning full-stack development with a focus on React.js on the frontend and Node.js/Express on the backend. Along the way, I’m also getting comfortable with JavaScript, TypeScript and databases like MongoDB and PostgreSQL so that I can understand the complete flow of a web application.",
      "Most of my growth comes from self-study, mini-projects, hackathons and practice sessions. I like to write code step by step, clean up my own mistakes and keep improving my logic and structure. I’m also interested in UI/UX, so I try to keep my interfaces simple, readable and user-friendly.",
      "When I’m not coding, I think about career planning, explore new tech tools and try to help friends with their doubts whenever I can. I believe consistent effort matters more than speed, and I want to keep learning until I can contribute to meaningful real-world projects with a good team."
